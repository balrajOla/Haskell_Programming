1. 𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑧 
    a) 𝜆𝑥𝑧.𝑥𝑧 
    b) 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑧 
    c) 𝜆𝑧.(𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑧)

Answer: 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑧 this is the correct answer because using Alpha Equivalence Principle we can replace 
        x with m and y with n. Since x is also present in expression body we will replace that too.
        Hence getting an expression 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑧


2. 𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑥𝑦
    a) 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑛𝑝 
    b) 𝜆𝑥.(𝜆𝑦.𝑥𝑦)
    c) 𝜆𝑎.(𝜆𝑏.𝑎𝑎𝑏)

Answer: 𝜆𝑎.(𝜆𝑏.𝑎𝑎𝑏) this is the correct answer because when we try to reduce both the above expressions 
        we land up in having the same reduced format.


3. 𝜆𝑥𝑦𝑧.𝑧𝑥 
    a) 𝜆𝑥.(𝜆𝑦.(𝜆𝑧.𝑧)) 
    b) 𝜆𝑡𝑜𝑠.𝑠𝑡 
    c) 𝜆𝑚𝑛𝑝.𝑚𝑛

Answer: 𝜆𝑡𝑜𝑠.𝑠𝑡 this is the answer using Alpha Equivalence
