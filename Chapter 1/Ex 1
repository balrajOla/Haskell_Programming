1. 𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑧 
    a) 𝜆𝑥𝑧.𝑥𝑧 
    b) 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑧 
    c) 𝜆𝑧.(𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑧)

Answer: 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑧 this is the correct answer because using Alpha Equivalence Principle we can replace 
        x with m and y with n. Since x is also present in expression body we will replace that too.
        Hence getting an expression 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑧


2. 𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑥𝑦
    a) 𝜆𝑚𝑛.𝑚𝑛𝑝 
    b) 𝜆𝑥.(𝜆𝑦.𝑥𝑦)
    c) 𝜆𝑎.(𝜆𝑏.𝑎𝑎𝑏)

Answer: 𝜆𝑎.(𝜆𝑏.𝑎𝑎𝑏) this is the correct answer because when we try to reduce both the above expressions 
        we land up in having the same reduced format.
